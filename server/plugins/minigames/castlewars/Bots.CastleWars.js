/**
 * Castle Wars bots. The lobby seeds each bot with a role in the "castlewars:bot-role"
 * attribute (game.BOT_ROLE_KEY); this unit turns that role into behaviour while the bot is
 * inside a live game:
 *
 *   attacker - storm the enemy castle, fight anyone in reach, otherwise batter the enemy
 *              large door down (a door swing is rooted to the clicked tile, so the bot
 *              stands still between swings);
 *   flag     - run the castle's scripted ladder route to the enemy standard, capture it
 *              with an empty weapon slot, carry it home and score at the team's own stand;
 *   guard    - climb to the team's own stand, kill intruders around it and hold the post.
 *
 * Every bot gets a core BotController (one per player, built lazily) ticked from the game
 * area's inGameProcessors. The routes are the CLIMB_ROUTES chains from Data.CastleWars.js;
 * when a bot is left behind on another floor the route resumes at the first step on its
 * current floor, and a bot that cannot make progress falls back to a hold position instead
 * of freezing. Controllers go away on "castlewars:reset" and on logout.
