/**
 * Tower of Life (members).
 *
 * The words come from the "Tower of Life" transcript page; this plugin supplies the
 * variant selectors for Effigy, Bonafido, 'Black-eye', 'No fingers', 'Gummy', 'The Guns',
 * 'Transmute'/'Currency' the Alchemists and the Homunculus, the builder's-costume
 * hand-ins (hard hat quiz, beer for the shirt, plant trousers, pickpocketed boots), the
 * tower door checks, the three repair machines, the top-floor creation cutscene, the
 * Homunculus mind puzzle and the basement hand-in.
 *
 * Stages (varbit 3337 "tol_prog", varp 977 "tol" bits 0-4; the stage values are the
 * tol_prog indexes at which the tower's multi-NPCs 6154/6155/6157/6158 resolve to their
 * real Effigy/Homunculus/Transmute/Currency ids, read from the cache transform tables):
 *   2  Effigy started me on the quest (go and see Bonafido)
 *   3  Bonafido wants me to prove myself: get the builder's costume
 *   4  Bonafido's test passed; admitted to the tower (wearing the costume)
 *   6  pressure machine, pipe machine and cage all working; tell Effigy
 *   8  Effigy has gone to the top of the tower; follow her
 *  11  the creation scene watched; confront the alchemists downstairs
 *  12  back at the top: help the Homunculus make sense of its mind
 *  14  mind fixed; talk to Effigy, then meet the Homunculus in the dungeon
 *  16  complete
 * The machine progress bits (3338 tol_pres_prog / 3339 tol_pipe_prog / 3340 tol_cage_prog,
 * 3354 tol_cage_state and 3372 tol_trapdoor_open) drive the client's multi-loc scenery
 * (object parents 21943/21941/21944, cache transform tables read from the cache); the
 * server mirrors them from the persisted attributes below.
 *
 * Machine handling: the pressure/pipe/cage objects each start their wiki repair transcript
 * ("Fix"); the "If missing materials" prose condition is answered from the inventory and the
 * construct action consumes the materials. The puzzle interfaces are not reproduced (they
 * are cache interfaces no plugin can drive), so the open-interface stage direction is
 * answered by completing the machine and sending the wiki's own "The machine is working!"
 * lines. 3359 tol_homonc_pres shows the freed Homunculus at the tower during the scare.
 *
 * Source: OSRS Wiki "Tower of Life" and its quick guide (requirements: 10 Construction,
 * hammer, saw, a regular beer; rewards: 2 Quest points, 1,000 Construction, 500 Crafting,
 * 500 Thieving and access to Creature Creation). The satchel is a Creature Creation drop,
 * not a quest reward, so it is not granted here.
 *
 * Gaps / approximations:
 *  - The machine calibration interfaces (pressure valve/lever puzzle, pipe jigsaw, cage bar
 *    puzzle) are replaced by completing the machine when it is constructed, as above.
 *  - The tower door is not in Doors.plugin.js's door catalog ("Tower door" is not one of its
 *    names), so opening it moves the checked player through instead of swapping door models.
 *  - The trapdoor to the dungeon opens only once the Homunculus has been freed ("The trapdoor
 *    won't budge." otherwise); its climb-down and the dungeon ladder's climb-up are routed
 *    through the Ladders plugin with explicit destinations ((3038,4376) dungeon landing).
 *  - Searching any tower plant yields the trousers on the first try (the wiki's plants differ
 *    only by chance); the crates always give their wiki contents (21908 gives nothing, 21916 a
 *    triangle sandwich).
 *  - Effigy has no post-quest transcript variant, so a completed player replays the
 *    "talking-to-effigy-again" conversation; the scare-scene repeat also reuses it.
 *  - Creature Creation (the post-quest altar activity) is not implemented; the quest only
 *    grants its access as a reward line.
 *  - The Homunculus mind puzzle asks one question per conversation (the transcript wraps the
 *    questions in a condition run the runtime resolves once), so the bar is filled over
 *    repeated talks; after the first answer the lead-in is skipped.
